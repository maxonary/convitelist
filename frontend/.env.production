# Disable ESLint webpack plugin in react-scripts build
# 
# Why: react-scripts 5.0.1 bundles ESLint 8.x and @typescript-eslint 5.x internally,
# but resolves our project's ESLint 9.x and @typescript-eslint 8.x at runtime,
# causing incompatible rule option shapes (e.g., no-unused-expressions).
#
# Solution: Disable ESLint during react-scripts build. Linting is handled separately
# via "npm run lint" which uses ESLint 9 with proper flat config.
#
# TODO: Remove this when upgrading to a react-scripts version that supports ESLint 9,
# or when migrating away from react-scripts (e.g., to Vite).
